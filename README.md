# BATCH_decoder

Insert the link to the file from which you want to retrieve the source code into 'file_path'.

Insert the link where you want to receive the decrypted file into 'file_output_path'.

Insert the KEY into 'old_string'.

The location of the KEY is shown in the example:
Set key=650hFGKcaelOPBjqkWTtdXRyUDHsvrfA9MuYQ8x1pzLIw2g4EnmCbZ3JNVi7oS

Then 'old_string' will look like this:
old_string = r'%key:'

Next, remove everything from the batch file, leaving only what was after the '=' sign in the key (refer to example.txt) and the encrypted code of the program itself.

P.S., you don't need to remove the 'cls' command.
